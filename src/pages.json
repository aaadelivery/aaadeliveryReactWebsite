Please be aware that when you enter the recipient's email address through our Services, your name, e-mail address and physical address may be included in the communication sent to the recipient.\n\n### f. Geolocation Data\n\nWith respect to geolocation data we track through Mobile Devices, we use that geolocation information for various purposes including for you to be able to set the location from which you wish your package to be picked up and delivered, to track courier progress and provide that information to you and your recipient, to send you promotions and offers, and to allow you (if you choose through any features we may provide) to share this information with other people.

When You Agree to Receive Information from Third Parties\n\nYou may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and marketing offers directly from third parties. If you do agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to such third parties and all information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to agreeing to receive such information from them. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.\n\n### b. Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.\n\nWe use third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, provide or perform certain aspects of the Services on our behalf. We may provide vendors with access to user information, including Personal Information, this information sharing is limited to only the information needed by the vendor to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Each of these vendors are obligated not to disclose or use Personal Information for any other purpose.\n\nWhile we may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Services and viewing of our content, we do not share Personal Information with these analytics service providers, but they may set and access their own cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including non-personally identifiable information.\n\nWe use a third-party hosting provider who hosts our support section of our website. Information collected within this section of our website is governed by our Privacy Policy.\n\n### c. Contests and Promotions\n\nWe may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a \"Promotion\") through the Services that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.\n\n### d. Legal Reasons\n\nWe cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. Thus, we may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your information (including Personal Information), including disclosure to third parties such as government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we reasonably determine is necessary and appropriate: (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal process; (ii) to protect and/or defend the Terms of Service for online and mobile Services or other policies applicable to any online and mobile Services, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) to protect the safety, rights, property or security of AAA Delivery Service, our Services or any third party; (iv) to protect the safety of the public for any reason; (v) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (vi) to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity. Further, we may use IP address or other Device Identifiers, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third parties, all in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.\n\n### e. Business Transfer\n\nWe may share your information, including your Personal Information and Usage Information with our parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates for internal reasons. We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Services or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our membership interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process.\n\n## 4. Behavioral Advertising and Opt-Out\n\nTargeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web or mobile browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than our website. For example, if you have shown a preference for football while visiting our website, you may be served an advertisement for football-related equipment when you visit a site other than our website. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie identifier; it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address, or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from us or through third party website publishers.\n\nIf you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from us that occurs when visiting our third-party advertising publishers, please click here to access the NAI Opt-Out Page. Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from us and any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you may continue to receive online advertising from us; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you.\n\nIn order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your Device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new Device, access our Services from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.\n\nAdditionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.\n\n## 5. Third Party Content and Links to Third Party Services\n\nThe Services may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect website usage information and your Device Identifier when web pages from any online or mobile Services are served to your browser. In addition, when you are using the Services, you may be directed to other sites or applications that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these third parties. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click may take you away from one of our websites onto a different website. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. When you leave our website or Services, please be sure to read the privacy statements of all third-party websites or applications before submitting any Personal Information to third parties.\n\n## 6. Social Media Features\n\nOur Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets such as a \"Share This\" button, or interactive mini programs that run on our online and mobile Services. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our online or mobile Services and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our online Services. Your interactions with these features and widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.\n\n## 7. Changing Your Information\n\nYou are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of account registration. If your Personal Information changes, or if you no longer desire our Services, you may correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making the change on our member information page or by contacting us through customer support. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\nYou may modify your account or the communications that you have elected to receive from the Services by following the instructions contained within an e-mail or by logging into your user account and changing your communication preferences.\n\nWe will retain your Personal Information and Usage Information (including geolocation) for as long as your account with the Services is active and as needed to provide you services. We will retain your Personal Information and Usage Information (including geolocation, delivery history, credit card information and transaction history) as needed to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, conclude any activities related to cancellation of an account (such as addressing chargebacks from your credit card companies), investigate or prevent fraud and other inappropriate activity, to enforce our agreements, and for other business reason. After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively, but our use of the anonymized data will be solely for analytic purposes.\n\n## 8. No Children\n\nOur Services are not directed toward minors, no one under 18 (and certainly no children under 13) are allowed to register with or use the Services. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18. If we discover that we have collected Personal Information from a person under 18, we will delete as soon as reasonably possible. If you are a parent or guardian of a minor under the age of eighteen (18) and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at [privacy@aaadeliveryservice.com](roger@aaadeliveryservice.com)\n\n## 9. Security\n\nThe Personal Information and Usage Information we collect is securely stored within our databases, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls, and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information - such as any portions of your credit card number which we retain (we do not ourselves retain your entire credit card information) and geolocation information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or wireless communication, and any information you transmit to AAA Delivery Service you do at your own risk. We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.\n\n## 10. Your California Privacy Rights\n\nAAA Delivery Service collects various types of personal information about you both online and offline, as described in this privacy policy. Under California law, AAA Delivery Service customers who are residents of California may request certain information about our disclosure of personal information during the prior calendar year to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please write to us at the following address:\n\n8813 N Tarrant Pkwy\nSuite 236\nNorth Richland Hills, TX 76182\n\nAlternatively, you may send us an email at [privacy@aaadeliveryservice.com](roger@aaadeliveryservice.com) with the words \"California Privacy Rights\" in the subject line.\n\nAAA Delivery Service does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.\n\nAAA Delivery Service offers interactive services which allow you to post content to share publicly. At any time, you can delete or remove content you have posted using the deletion or removal options within our services. If you have questions about how to remove content in a specific service or if you would like additional assistance with deletion, you can contact support. Although we offer deletion capability for our services, you should be aware that the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the services.\n\n## 11. Information Processed And Stored In The United States\n\nInformation we collect, including, Personal Information, will be processed and stored in the United States. Your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Services or providing us with any information, you consent to the processing and storage of your information in the United States.\n\n## 12.
